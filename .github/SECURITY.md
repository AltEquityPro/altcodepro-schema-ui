## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not create a public GitHub issue**.  
Instead, report it responsibly via one of the following:

- 📧 Email: security@altcode.pro  
- 🔒 Private GitHub Security Advisory (preferred): [Submit here](https://github.com/altcodepro/schema-ui/security/advisories/new)  

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**, and aim to provide a fix or mitigation within **7–14 days** depending on severity.

---

## Disclosure Policy

- We ask security researchers to **not disclose details publicly** until a fix has been released.  
- Once resolved, we will publish a **Security Advisory** on GitHub and release a patched version.  
- Researchers who report responsibly will be credited in the changelog.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- The `@altcodepro/schema-ui` npm package  
- Any generated code/runtime that ships with it  
- Documentation and example configs (if they expose security flaws)

It does **not** apply to:

- Third-party integrations (S3/GCS/Stripe/others)  
- Projects built on top of AltCodePro by external developers  

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure).  
If in doubt, err on the side of private disclosure.

Thank you for helping us keep **AltCodePro projects safe & secure** 🔐
